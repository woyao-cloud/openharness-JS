"""Typed options container for :func:`query` and :class:`OpenHarnessClient`.

Mirrors Claude Code's ``ClaudeAgentOptions``. Bundles the 12 kwargs the
entry points accept into a single frozen dataclass so IDE discoverability
is better and config objects can be built incrementally by test helpers
or higher-level wrappers.

Usage::

    from openharness import OpenHarnessClient, OpenHarnessOptions

    opts = OpenHarnessOptions(
        model="ollama/llama3",
        permission_mode="trust",
        max_turns=5,
    )
    async with OpenHarnessClient(**opts.to_kwargs()) as client:
        ...

Unpacking with ``**opts.to_kwargs()`` lets individual kwargs override
fields inline::

    async with OpenHarnessClient(
        **opts.to_kwargs(),
        model="anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6",
    ) as client:
        ...

We intentionally do not add a magic ``options=`` kwarg to the entry
points — that would create ambiguity when both ``options`` and an
individual kwarg are set. ``to_kwargs()`` + unpacking is explicit and
plays well with ``mypy --strict``.
